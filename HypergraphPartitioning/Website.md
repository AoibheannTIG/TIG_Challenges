## Hypergraph Partitioning Challenge
### *We are excited to introduce our brand new challenge for TIG:* 

## Problem Description and Formulation

The Hypergraph Partitioning challenge at TIG can be formulated as follows:

**Goal:** Divide a hypergraph into a specified number of balanced partitions while minimizing the number of cut hyperedges.

Consider a hypergraph H consisting of a set of nodes (vertices) V and a set of hyperedges (nets) N, where each hyperedge is a subset of nodes.  The aim is to partition the nodes into groups (parts) such that the number of hyperedges spanning two or more parts—that is, the number of cut hyperedges—is minimized.

**Constraints:**
1. Each node must only belong to exactly one part.
2. Each part must contain at least one node.
3. The total weight of each part, w_k, must not exceed the average part weight by more than an allowed imbalance tolerance i.e.:
w_k \leq \frac{\text{num\_nodes}}{64} \times (1 + \epsilon)
```
w_k \leq num_nodes / 64 \times (1 + \epsilon)
```
**Objective**
The objective is to minimize the connectivity, i.e.: the number of parts each hyperedge spans.

## Example

## Our Challenge

At TIG, the baseline connectivity is determined by the greedy bipartition approach. The challenge is to develop algorithms that improve upon this baseline by at least the specified factor (`better_than_baseline`).

## Applications

Hypergraphs are a powerful tool for representing complex networks in which relationships may involve more than two elements simultaneously. Hypergraph partitioning refers to dividing such a network into a specified number of groups that are roughly equal in size while keeping as many related items together as possible. Although the problem is computationally challenging (NP-hard), it has broad applications across numerous fields:

* **Parallel Computing & Load Balancing:** By intelligently distributing tasks across processors, hypergraph partitioning minimizes communication overhead and enhances overall computational efficiency [^1][^2][^3][^4][^5].
* **Distributed Neural Network Training:** It enables the partitioning of compute graphs across multiple GPUs or servers, significantly accelerating the training of deep learning models [^6][^7].
* **VLSI & Circuit Design:** By effectively grouping circuit components, it optimizes chip layouts and reduces interconnect complexity, leading to faster and more efficient designs [^8][^9].
* **Social Networks & Community Detection:** Capturing multi-way relationships, hypergraph partitioning reveals hidden community structures and provides deeper insights into group dynamics [^10].
* **Bioinformatics & Computational Biology:** It facilitates the clustering of proteins, genes, and genomic regions to identify functional modules, thereby aiding discovery in biological research [^11].
* **Machine Learning & Data Mining:** By effectively modeling higher-order interactions, it improves data clustering and feature selection, enhancing analytical outcomes [^12].
* **Other Applications:** From optimizing database sharding and segmenting GIS regions to modularizing software systems, hypergraph partitioning transforms large-scale challenges into more tractable problems [^1][^7][^4].

In the rapidly evolving field of Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) — which leverage blockchain technology and distributed nodes to manage physical assets — hypergraph partitioning plays an especially important role. By accurately modeling complex interactions, it can effectively group related tasks and resources across scenarios such as decentralized compute/storage, blockchain data sharding, IoT networks, or supply chain logistics [^16]. This grouping helps minimize cross-node communication and balances workloads, ultimately enhancing the scalability and performance of these decentralized systems [^15].
